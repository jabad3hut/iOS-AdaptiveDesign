### Tuts+ Tutorial: An Introduction to Adaptive Design

#### Instructor: Jordan Morgan

Apple has been pushing developers to create universal iOS applications for some time now. At WWDC 12, Auto Layout was released for iOS and improvements followed for it in iOS 7. And now with iOS 8, adaptive design has been introduced, which includes several new APIs and Interface Builder advancements to promote developing universal binaries.

In this tutorial, we will look at what exactly adaptive design means and how to use some of its concepts. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to use adaptive design to create universal apps using an intuitive workflow. We'll use the new size classes to create a fictional app for a computer store that works on all devices.
